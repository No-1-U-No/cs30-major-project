# Project Description

I am going to build a Buzzfeed-style quiz that tells you what popular 2023 song is your jam. This won't include every single song; I will pick up to ~150 possibilities, depending on time and if I can do so depending on the scores. Also to note is that these were not necessarily released in 2023, but rather popular in 2023.

## Needs to Have List:
- About 20 questions that mostly relate to determining the jam (some Buzzfeed music tests have questions completely unrelated to music, i.e. "What is your favourite food?", so I hope my questions will be more logical).
- If the user wants to change their answer, they can scroll back up and change it.
- Once the test is finished, display a rectangle with the song they should listen to (and possibly give a few sentences on why it would be their jam), aka display the result.
- Either embed YouTube video to the result, or provide a link that allows them to listen to the audio (would prefer option #1 since I've had previous struggles with fuzzy/cutting audio files).
- If I end up going with separate screens for each question, the quiz must be responsive with screen dimensions.

## Nice to Have List:
- After the user selects a choice, the screen will jump down to the next question, rather than the user having to scroll down themselves (some Buzzfeed tests automatically jump down while some require manual scrolling, and based off my experiences, I would much prefer if it jump down for the user).
- I can have one long page with all the choices and the result, rather than creating a new screen for each choice (since going back to change a choice will be extremely tedious).
- Incorporate HTML elements (ex. embedding YouTube video, renaming sketch.js, changing favicon) if unable to do with JavaScript.
- If I can create the long page, it would be amazing if I can make it responsive with the dimensions of the screen.
- Possibly make it a mobile-friendly game?
