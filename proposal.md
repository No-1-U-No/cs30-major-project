# Project Description:

I am going to build a Buzzfeed-style quiz that tells you what popular 2023 song is your jam. This won't include every single song; I will pick at least 20 possibilities, but will do more if time allows and if it won't get confusing in the code. Also to note is that they were not necessarily released in 2023, but rather popular in 2023.

## Needs to Have List:

- About 20 questions that mostly relate to determining the jam (some Buzzfeed music tests have questions completely unrelated to music, i.e. "What is your favourite food?", so I hope my questions will be more logical).
- If the user wants to change their answer, they can go back and change it.
- Once the test is finished, display their jam (and possibly give a few sentences on why it would be their jam), and either embed YouTube video or provide a link that takes them to YouTube or Spotify to listen to the audio (though I would prefer embedding the video).
- The layout must look good and resize well to most computer and mobile screen dimensions (for mobile screens, they will not need to scroll horizontally and most likely will not have to squint or zoom in to look at the text).

## Nice to Have List:

<!-- Scrapping the following items, after discussing the proposal, since they all relate to HTML: -->
<!-- - After the user selects a choice, the screen will jump down to the next question, rather than the user having to scroll down themselves (some Buzzfeed tests automatically jump down while some require manual scrolling, and based off my experiences, I would much prefer if it jump down for the user).
- I can have one long page with all the choices and the result, rather than creating a new screen for each choice (since going back to change a choice will be extremely tedious).
- Incorporate HTML elements (ex. embedding YouTube video, renaming sketch.js, changing favicon) if unable to do with JavaScript.
- If I can create the long page, it would be amazing if I can make it responsive with the dimensions of the screen.
- Possibly make it a mobile-friendly game? -->

<!-- This is the new "Nice to Have" list: -->
- If I get the hang of well-redesigned layout for computers and mobiles, I'll modify the layout for tablets (if not already done from the computers and mobiles, since they may just cover all the conditions with the width vs. height question).
- Make a favicon for the quiz (or get one from somewhere, if allowed).
- Not allow the user to skip over a question, and possibly do something to let the user know that they are not allowed to skip (ex. stroke the "Next" button red, display a message, etc.).
- Allow users to share (ex. post, print, save) and/or react to their results (at the end of Buzzfeed quizzes, there's a section that lets users react to their results with "CUTE", "FAIL", "LOL", "OMG", "WIN", and "WTF", so I may do something similar).
