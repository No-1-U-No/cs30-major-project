# Major Project Reflection

## What advice would I give myself if I were to do a project like this again?
- My main advice going into the project was to **not** leave the project to the last minute, and since I did so, I felt way less stress throughout the project, and I could gradually accomplish things nearly every day.
- My second-main advice was to not worry about the awesome games some of my classmates were making, and since I did so, I felt much happier with my results because I focused on my own limits.
- My third-main advice was to add comments while I code, but since I _didn't_ do so, I had to do it all at the end, and I occasionally struggled at figuring out what each block of code did since I'd made it months beforehand.

## Did I complete everything in my "Needs to Have" list?
- Yes; everything in my "Needs to Have" list was successfully implemented in the end.

## What was the hardest part of the project?
- Spotify embedding was the hardest part of the project.
- Since the embeds are HTML, I had to relearn how to center DIV elements on the page.
- Songs wouldn't play after I centered the embeds, so I removed two of Spotify's own attributes, and then the songs played again.

## Were there any problems I could not solve?
- I wanted to embed YouTube videos more than Spotify audios, but I found out that YouTube has a strict CORS policy that forbids some videos from being embedded on localhost web servers, so I settled with Spotify audios.
- I just discovered near the end of the project that different web browsers have different user agents, so my mobile detector works well on Google Chrome, but it may not work with other browsers.
- If you play the song (which you should do!) and you retake the test, the song doesn't stop playing until Spotify's own preview is done, but this isn't a really big deal.
